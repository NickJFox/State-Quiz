# State-Quiz

## Take a quiz to see which U.S. state you belong in based on a series of questions. All 50 states are potential answers!

The provided code utilizes arrays and objects to store and manipulate data. Arrays are used to hold option IDs and track user selections, while objects are used to organize and retrieve information about states and their preferences. 

Iterative algorithms, such as loops, are employed to iterate over arrays and perform operations. 

Additionally, event-driven programming is utilized through event listeners to respond to user interactions. These algorithms and data structures enable the code to dynamically handle user input, calculate matching state preferences, and display relevant information.  

* Create a quiz to find which U.S. state you belong in.
* Store and receive preferences set to objects (all 50 states).
* Take user input and match with object preferences to determine a result (highest match).
* Create next and previous buttons with tabs.
* Display result based on ID selections.
* Display the state winner's images and iconic food that is also stored to the state object.
